## Installation

Add the latest version of `codacy-coverage` to your package.json:

```sh
npm install codacy-coverage --save
```

If you're using mocha, add `mocha-lcov-reporter` to your package.json:

```sh
npm install mocha-lcov-reporter --save
```

## Enterprise

To send coverage in the enterprise version you should specify your Codacy installation URL with the option `-e`:

```sh
codacy-coverage -e <YOUR-CODACY-ENTERPRISE-URL>:16006
```

## Usage

This cli can take standard input from any tool that emits the lcov data format (including [mocha](http://mochajs.org)'s [LCov reporter](https://npmjs.org/package/mocha-lcov-reporter)) and send it to Codacy to report your code coverage there.

Once your app is instrumented for coverage, and building, you need to pipe the lcov output to `codacy-coverage`.

### Identifying the project

You'll need to provide the secret Project API token from `Codacy Project > Settings > Integrations > Project API` via:

* (Recommended) Environment variable: CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN
* CLI parameter variable: `--token`

> Note: You should keep your any API token well **protected**, as it grants owner permissions to your projects.

### Test Coverage

#### [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) + [Blanket.js](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket)

* Install [blanket.js](http://blanketjs.org/)
* Configure blanket according to [docs](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_node.md).
* Add test with coverage step to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "NODE_ENV=test YOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE=1 mocha --require blanket --reporter mocha-lcov-reporter | codacy-coverage"
}
```

* Run your tests with:

```sh
npm run test-with-coverage
```

#### [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) + [JSCoverage](https://github.com/fishbar/jscoverage)

Instrumenting your app for coverage is probably harder than it needs to be (read [here](http://www.seejohncode.com/2012/03/13/setting-up-mocha-jscoverage/)), but that's also a necessary step.

* Add test with coverage step to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "YOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE=1 mocha test -R mocha-lcov-reporter | codacy-coverage"
}
```

* Run your tests with:

```sh
npm run test-with-coverage
```

#### [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)

##### With Mocha

* Add test with coverage step to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "istanbul cover _mocha --report lcovonly -- -R spec && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | codacy-coverage && rm -rf ./coverage"
}
```

* Run your tests with:

```sh
npm run test-with-coverage
```

##### With Jasmine

* Add test with coverage step to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "istanbul cover jasmine-node --captureExceptions spec/ && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | codacy-coverage && rm -rf ./coverage"
}
```

* Run your tests with:

```sh
npm run test-with-coverage
```

#### [Poncho](https://github.com/deepsweet/poncho)

Client-side JS code coverage using [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs), [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) and [Blanket](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket):

* [Configure](http://mochajs.org#browser-support) Mocha for browser
* [Mark](https://github.com/deepsweet/poncho#usage) target script(s) with `data-cover` html-attribute
* Add test with coverage step to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "poncho -R lcov test/test.html | codacy-coverage"
}
```

* Run your tests with:

```sh
npm run test-with-coverage
```

#### [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

* Add test with coverage step to your package.json:

Note: [jest might return exit code 1](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3520) if you defined a coverage threshold and the threshold is not met

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "jest --coverage && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | codacy-coverage"
}
```

* Run your tests with:

```sh
npm run test-with-coverage
```

## Extras

### Account Token

As an alternative to the Project API token you can also send coverage using your account/api token by following steps:

* Add test with coverage step to your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "cat ./coverage/lcov.info | codacy-coverage --accountToken <account-token> --username <username> --projectName <project-name>"
}
```

* Run your tests with:

```sh
npm run test-with-coverage
```

You'll need to provide the secret Account API token from [Codacy Account](https://app.codacy.com/account/apiTokens)` > API Tokens` via:

* (Recommended) Environment variable: CODACY_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
* CLI parameter variable: `--accountToken`

### Force custom language (e.g. Typescript, Coffeescript, C, ...)

* Pass an extra parameter to the codacy-coverage reporter `--language typescript` or `--language coffeescript`.
* If you have multiple languages you need to invoke the reporter for each of them.

### Run in Windows

If you are running coverage in a windows machine without Unix tools,
you need to change the command to `codacy-coverage < ./test/unit/coverage/lcov.info`.

## Troubleshooting

### Path Problems

The paths in your coverage file should be relative,
if you are having problems with absolute paths,
you can run our plugin with `-p .` to strip the current path from the paths in your coverage file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "cat ./coverage/lcov.info | codacy-coverage -p ."
}
```

### Enterprise Coverage

To send coverage in the **enterprise** version you should specify your Codacy installation URL followed by the port 16006 using the -e option, example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-with-coverage": "cat ./coverage/lcov.info | codacy-coverage -e <YOUR-CODACY-ENTERPRISE-URL>:16006"
}
```

## Options

```bash
Options:

  -V, --version               output the version number
  -f, --format [value]        Coverage input format
  -t, --token [value]         Codacy Project API Token
